# {{$frontmatter.title}}

We think critical infrastructure, like API3 DAO's first-party oracles, should
implement open and transparent processes suitable for what will be a
programmatically driven protocol.

To support DAO governance all core teams publish a public proposal at regular
intervals, meaning strategy & operations are accessible on the
[API3 Governance Forum](https://forum.api3.org/) for all to understand.
Additionally, teams generally update the community with retrospective reports.

# API3 DAO welcomes community participation

Community participants within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) have
an active role in shaping the future of the project. Our aim is to simplify the
process for those who wish to participate, providing predefined methods for
engagement. Generally these take forum in three routes:

1- Core team contributions 2- Completion of pre-defined bounties 3- New
intiatives or ideas

### Contributors can engage with proposals made by the core teams

If contributors feel they possess particular skills or expertise that may
benefit the proposal's execution, they can directly communicate with the
proposal leads. This collaborative approach encourages a diverse array of
viewpoints and fosters a proactive culture where everyone's skills and
experiences are leveraged for the benefit of the DAO's objectives.

### Take on pre-defined bounties

Community participants have the opportunity to engage with pre-set bounties,
organized in a modular structure to offer clear and attainable tasks. For
instance, a bounty might be created for a specific job that is expected to be
completed within two days. This structure allows any member of the community to
take on the job, complete it, and subsequently receive the designated grant as a
reward.

Should participants wish to discuss the job before beginning, they are
encouraged to do so within the [API3 Discord channel](), fostering an
environment of open communication and collaborative decision-making. Moreover,
if members have ideas for new bounty challenges, they are welcome to propose
them, allowing for a constant influx of fresh ideas and fostering a sense of
ownership and participation in the community's shared goals.

<!--To see the current community bounties see the community bounty notion board.-->

### Propose ideas and new initiatives

Many of the core team contributors were API3 community members and a strategic
advatnage of API3 is the ability for the viewpoints of the community to turn
into idea. We welcome ad-hoc ideas that support proposals or broader initatives
that would support the DAO.

Individuals with a technical background can contribute to the project (through
development, integrations, writing documentation, etc.). The general point is
that one needs to be able to use a solution proficiently before being able to
improve it.

# Getting started

We recommend spending some time learning about API3 DAO's oracle technology
before looking to contribute from an engineer perspective. We welcome you to ask
any questions on [Discord<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W).

### Explore API3

- Read the
  [getting started<ExternalLinkImage/>](docs/explore/introduction/index.md)
  secontion in the API3 Docs
- (For the curious) Explore the API3 codebase on
  [GitHub<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao)
- If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read
  [Mastering Ethereum<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
  cover to cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will
  need to know about superficially.

### Technical contributors

- Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not
  expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions.
- Visit the [API3 GitHub<externalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao) page
  and find everything about.. everything. Explore the many repositories to gain
  in-depth knowledge about API3.
- Go through the issues, PRs, etc. and understand the current focus of the
  development team by viewing the development board.

### Technical tutorials

- Integrate an API to an Airnode (Run and understand the Airnode starter
  tutorial)
- Build a dApp that uses API3 QRNG
- Utilize API3 Price Feeds

### Engage

This page will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to
create
[GitHub issues<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao/vitepress-docs/issues)
to make suggestions.

# Contributing to the Technical Documentation

See the [dev documentation](/dev/) for an overview of the API3 technical
documentation site. It contains instructions on the make-up of the docs and on
how to clone, setup, and run the project locally. For non-DAO members a PR from
a fork is always welcome.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback for the documentation we always would like to hear it
within the community or via our feedback template. Contributions can be rewarded
within bounty frameworks if there is an appropiate fix and is scoped accurately.

## Submit an issue

We welcome all developers to contribute to the growth and enhancement of API3
DAO by submitting any issues or suggestions you come across via our issue
tracker - your insight is invaluable in making our technology better.

# Join the API3 community on the following services.

- [API3 Forum<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://forum.api3.org/)
